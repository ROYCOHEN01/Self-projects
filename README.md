SmartWallet App!
Overview
The SmartWallet app helps users manage their credit cards, gift cards, and memberships effectively. It allows users to store card details, check balances, and identify where each card is valid for optimal usage.

Motivation
I realized I lacked control over my credit cards, gift cards, and memberships, often unsure of their balances and where they were accepted. I decided to develop an application in my spare time that would solve this problem.

Features
Card Management: Store and manage credit cards, gift cards, and memberships.
Balance Tracking: Keep track of card balances in one place.
Location-Based Usage: Identify where each card is valid for informed usage decisions.
